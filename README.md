### Overview
For this assignment, we build an Employee Directory with React.

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

It is convenient to be able to narrow down the employees by name, that's why it was integrated in the search box a filter that can help look for an employee by their name
